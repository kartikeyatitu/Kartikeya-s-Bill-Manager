Tech Used -> 
React Hooks , Redux , React HighCharts  (for displaying Char). 
Certain stylings have been covered with bootstrap.





Futher Improvements That Can be Made are->
Using Bootstap Datatables to diplay list of biils and functionality of delete and edit .
I have made a single page application -> It can be converted to multi-page application by adding appropriate routes in react.
UI can be improved.
